Dora Roara the Door Restorer
===

A puzzle game where you pick up doors to make paths through walls. Try and reach the stairs!

Requirements
---

### Linux

The game requires [python2](http://www.python.org) and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org) to run - you probably already have python, and pygame should be available through your package manager.

### Windows

On Windows this may be annoying - the game works with python and pygame installed, but if you don't want to install that stuff, you may want to try out the [pre-built binary](http://fishface.org.uk/uploads/stuff/Dora.zip) which should work without python or pygame, but may not be up-to-date.

Gameplay
---
Reach the stairs down by cunningly placing doors to move through the level. Be careful, because in some locations devices prevent you from retrieving doors you've placed. You can throw doors up to three tiles away, and sometimes you'll need to throw doors over pits in order to proceed. If you get stuck, you can always undo or restart.
