Dora Roara the Door Restorer
===

A puzzle game where you pick up doors to make paths through walls. Try and reach the stairs!

Requirements
---
This game requires [python2](http://www.python.org) and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org) to run.
On windows this may be annoying, in which case you may want to try out the [pre-built binary](http://fishface.org.uk/static/stuff/dora.zip) which should work without python or pygame, but will generally not be up to date.

Gameplay
---
Reach the stairs down by cunningly placing doors to move through the level. Be careful, because in some locations devices prevent you from retrieving doors you've placed. You can throw doors up to three tiles away, and sometimes you'll need to throw doors over pits in order to proceed. If you get stuck, you can always undo or restart.
